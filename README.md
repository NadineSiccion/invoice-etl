# 🚀 ETL Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates an **ETL (Extract–Transform–Load)** pipeline using **Python, Batch Scripts, and VBA**.
It was inspired by a **real business problem encountered during work**. While this exact solution was not implemented in production, it represents a working alternative that could have automated reporting workflows, improved data consistency, and saved significant time.



## 📖 Background

Company XYZ was prospecting new call/SMS platforms to replace their current one. Thus, a financial analysis regarding the costs of the Company's SMS automated messaging over the last 7 years must be done.

This information is available in their past invoices in Software A, as well as other information that could be useful for future analysis. **However**, all invoices are stored in **PDF format** with no easy way to extract the data for analysis.

The goal of this project is to show how such a scenario could be solved by:

* **Extracting** data from heterogeneous sources (Excel, CSV, system dumps).
* **Transforming** it into a standardized format (cleaning, reshaping, normalizing).
* **Loading** the data into a structured schema, resembling a lightweight **data warehouse**, for downstream analysis and visualization.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Extract**

   * Python scripts pull data from raw files and system exports.
   * Extracted files are stored in `/data/input/`.

2. **Transform**

   * Python validates and cleans data.
   * Example: date normalization, removing duplicates, mapping inconsistent department codes.

3. **Load**

   * Python writes the final dataset into `/data/output/`.
   * Data is structured according to the **warehouse schema** (fact + dimension tables).

4. **Excel/VBA Automation**

   * A VBA macro (`cleanup_module.bas`) can be imported into Excel to apply final formatting for business users.

5. **Orchestration**

   * `run_etl.bat` triggers the ETL pipeline end-to-end.
